My technical choices were to use a donut chart ( I know the professor doesn't like them) to represent the users and nodes to represent branches with links being the commits. However I could not get the x and y coordinates of the donut chart that belonged to the users and therefore I was unable to create the links which were essential to the visualization. I though this would look awesome since I saw a similar example, the tradeoffs were that donut charts don't accurately represent proportions but the visualization would have been really beautiful.
